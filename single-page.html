            <h2>Interviewing Stakeholders</h2>
            <p>In order to understand our stakeholders, we need to directly interact with them. In doing so, I found that it allows us to create better products. At the moment when interviewing stakeholders, our primary goal was to understand what products or services might our market needs.</p>
            <p>I love interacting with people. I took this assignment as an opportunity to reconnect with family members and friends that I've lost touch with. I spoke with my uncle from Nepal about the group project to receive some insightful feedback about what customers might want. In doing so, we could get a better understanding of what features our product would need. I love talking to people and listening to their stories so I found that this was a great way to bond with them over a short phone call.</p>

            <h2>Creating the Persona</h2>
            <p>To complete our activity, we needed to develop user personas that could tell stories of our potential customers.</p>
            <p> I believe that the only way we can develop a strong product is by telling stories. After I looked at similarities between a group of stakeholders, I developed the user personas from the interviews conducted by my team. In this process, I found that there since our customers wanted a lot of key attributes to help lower the time it took to prepare a kid's meal. I communicated with my group that it would be difficult to solve all of the listed problems therefore, we should only identify problems for a specific submarket. Creating user personas taught me how to tell great stories and helped me understand that the nicher the market, the better the product.</p>

            <figcaption>During this interview, I found out from Effrain that as a parent he wants a solution that will <bold>promote healthy food options</bold> and <bold>save him a lot of time</bold>. When asking him how many hours he spends cooking for his kids per day, he said over 2.5 and this consumes a lot of his time. I want to help solve his problem. Throughout the interview, he was keen to share his ideas on how I could work on a solution for kids coming from underserved backgrounds.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>While developing the kid personas, after identifying the similarities between kids, I noticed that they loved objects that radiated bright colors and they were generally hungry around 9AM, 12PM, 3PM and 6PM. To find this out, we sent out simple short surveys to kids to fill out. </figcaption>

            <figcaption>While developing the personas, I compiled a list of interviews with parents and identifies similarities. I noticed that 2 working parents were generally busy around 9AM, 2PM and 9PM. Most parents said that they wanted a choice that was healthy for their kids and convenient for them.</figcaption>
